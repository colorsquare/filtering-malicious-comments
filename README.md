## About the Project

### Problem Description

These days, there are numerous online contents, such as movie or application reviews, and people react to them with comments. However, malicious comments are becoming a social problem. In this project, it starts with simple preference discriminator, and expands over different datasets. *Preference discriminator* refers to assessing how positive or negative the reviewers are about the content they watch or use. All works are done only with NLTK.
