I recognized the detective from previous films and comic bokks so to me she doesnt really need a story because it's pretty clear who she is..... I also had no idea that black mask's sidekick was Victor Szaas because he did not look like how he originally does in the books and in previous films. I didn't realize he was him until later on in the movie. Black Canary's character was amazing. The woman who played her did an awesome job. However, there was no characterization for her or anything to explain her story. The closest we got to her story was in her scene with the detective talking about how her mom got killed, when they should have put in a flashback scene from when her mom got killed and her upbringing . Same thing with batgirl. This would have helped to make the movie perfect, and I completely agree with what you are saying with this video, The only character's story that was clearly explained was Huntress's story. Although it was a good movie, I was very disappointed because Black Canary is often forgotten about when it comes to DC films, and batgirl is almost non existent. Hopefully they will make a separate movie about Black Canary and Batgirl, to give them a better introduction.", "cid": "UgxzxffgHWuPWRNgGT54AaABAg", "time": "2Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

Birds of prey was ok but I'd rather see Harley become more fleshed out as an independent character. Birds of prey was all over the place at times. It did flashbacks at the worst of times when they could've been used as a side story instead that would lead them all together at the end of the movie (like it did but this way would've added detail to the other characters too so they could have thier own movie in the future) instead of Harley telling you about them and showing the past in the middle of a good scene.\n Suicide squad wasn't the best movie and Leto's joker wasn't as good as he could've been but they both brought something to the table. Leto didn't nail the correct joker but her did nail the alternate version of the joker that was a gangster in the comics.\n My point is that birds of prey and suicide squad we're both ok movies but they could've been so much better if they had added a few scenes and took some out. Maybe suicide squad should've focused more on the team facing off against the joker while Harley struggled to break free of him and find her own way. That would've been the perfect set up for birds of prey to take place after suicide squad. It would've amplified the movies impact and showed Harley as an independent character that's leading towards her own goals. That's my thoughts on it.", "cid": "UgwvDku4hEmVfRB-XGN4AaABAg", "time": "2Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

The scene where Harlet stole the chemical van, it was like right next to the plant, why didnt the driver go there to finish his 'duty' instead of releasing off the street, like a normal person would do? And it must be a very dirty street if people just casually do their business there, but the police managed to find the neckalce shortly afterward which lead to Harley, seriously? And building don't just explode just because a van hit them, especially explode with firework!!\n2. Harley can't beat up a dozen of men which surround her, but manged to break into a police HQ pretty much unharmed??? At HQ, none of the the police have any gun?? and they all run at the sight of 1 girl??\n3. About the little thief girl, don't people get check up when they get arrested? she literally just casually take things out and hide them around her body.\n4. At the mall, the 2 girls stole a whole bunch of stuff and no guard or police chased after them?\n\n5. At Harley apartment, the scene she got attacked, there was like polices at the door, and gangsters down on the street, but they all magicall disappear after the explosion?? and the owner of the bar just stay at the scene when they were attacked, 'sorry I betrayed u' and just casually pack things up and leave? make no sense to me, I would already be far and away by that time if I was him.\n6. The female officer just sent 'I'll be there' to Black Canary after she received the message, is she dumb? She's an experienced police officer and she doesn't know the basic rule about spying: which is to not contact the spy in case he's occupied?\n7. The womans fighting each other scene. Harley can 1 shot a guy but she has hard time dealing with a drunk women? she got shot with a transquilizer but just got immobilize for a few minutes? the Huntress is an assasin but alway have a direct confrontation and just 'I'm already killed him so I'm leaving'?\n8. The girls like 'he brought an army with him, we need to work together' and have a direct confrontation with them. I mean, hello, they outnumbered u 10 to 1, while u are just some girls (which include 1 drunk, 1 just got transquilized, and 1 kid).  I was expecting a some tactics, like setting trap and using the terrain to your advantage to win, but no, just walk straight up to them will do.\nThis is a good movie, with some awesome fighting and funny scene, but not a memorable one. I can watch it, have some good laugh and then forget all about it the next day.", "cid": "Ugwxd0hGRujjmGOjYh54AaABAg", "time": "2Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Honestly, I'm guessing from the main villain, but Black-Mask was made to be hated heavily, so it makes sense that they make him a misogynist ass-hole with no redeeming qualities.

Literally the entire film revolves around one theme - repressed women vs toxic masculinity. Almost every male depicted in this is a scumbag, with the remaining few being weak.

As for Black Mask, he was a complete joke. Was basically written to be the ultimate toxic male.

Thats a nod to her being an accessory to the second robin being beat to death with a crowbar. I got chills hearing that line but margots charisma makes you think ‚Äúanti hero‚Äù no... shes a villain. Maybe with some redeeming qualities but a evil son of a bitch. They had the impossible task of making me forget suicide squad and they succeeded. I even wanted to see that disaster again.

It's not to be taken seriously. Joker meanwhile is none of those things, it's a comic book movie that could be set in our real world. A lot of what Arthur (or all those clown protestors) does in the film mirrors actual incidents in our reality. It's dark, grim, and unhappy. Whether you like the film or not, that's what it is.\n\nAgain, the media controversy is dumb. These movies may have been based on DC comics but they aren't really the same thing.

In the first few issues, she kept going back to Joker but eventually with Poison Ivy's help she \"detoxes\" from her obsession with Joker. Admittedly, modern day continuity handles her emancipation arc with much less nuance and subtlety, and since this movie adapts from that it might not convince a lot of you. But either way, solo Harley Quinn has been canon for 20 years now, and you can't even say this is a feminist agenda pushed by women because Harley Quinn's solo stories in her 2000 series were not spearheaded by women writers.", "cid": "UgxhO8Gq4Rv_S0nRAad4AaABAg.95H13rkBv5i95P2rpCbvCM", "time": "3Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Perhaps you are just way misinformed and don't actually get any real news. Feminazi Producers OPENLY ADMIT what they are trying to do.  I have no problem at all and neither does anyone else with strong women in roles. Wonder Woman is one of my all time favorites. Sigourney Weaver in aliens is my all time favorite scifi thriller and Terminator 2 is my second. And while it's correct that technically she's not considered a hero because she does bad things she is Absolutely portrayed as a lovable smart villain and she's very good at it,  While every single man in the movie is treated as an idiot. That pattern is not a coincidence. I don't have a problem with a strong woman like captain Marvel but I have a problem when they intentionally throw in one liners about female superiority and try to minimize the strongest male roles to prop them up such as the disastrous treatment of Thor.  They literally turned one of the strongest bravest male characters of all time into a fat crying whimpering wussy who was a complete imbecile and coward just so that their female hero could look the strongest of them all. The problem is they are INTENTIONAL a trying to indoctrinate culture and I take great exception to that kind of trash from the sewer.

Her situation was kinda vague and made me wonder why she was still working for Black Mask, when she is actually a badass who can fend for herself. The rest were okay too. My main issues were the cringey dialogue, and as you mentioned, the whole \"I bet you wonder how I got into this situation\" trope, which was dropped at a very random point into the movie and didn't add any tension or anything. The timeline could've gone linear and it wouldn't have changed the story or how we perceived it. There was also the completely unnecessary Marilyn Monroe scene, which I guess was made for the trailer, so they wanted to squeeze it into the movie as well. That scene could've completely been cut out and it wouldn't have changed anything. These were the random weird things I noticed.", "cid": "UgyZID0anAZi8wIBgVB4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Is there something I'm missing? I liked the action scenes and character development. I liked joker too, but if I'm being completely honest the way that movie depicts mental illness and how we're supposed to sympathize with a murderer is simply offensive and just plain stigmatizing. Also alot of the scenes in the joker are just him dancing lol. Also also the whole rich and poor conflict while important was handled completely wrong. I don't know it just seems like the movie paints all rich people as narcissistic, unsympathetic, and just plain cruel. The whole city also siding with the joker over murdering three man is just ridiculous.", "cid": "UgzgJwg_gxkVJ6FnYm54AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

They are both horrible people, and yet fun and flashy, so we LOVE them. We love the hyenas, we love the giant mallet, we love that LAUGH. Mark Hamill's nJoker laugh set the bar. Also the Harley Quinn in the same series set the bar, especially that episode where she runs off with Poison Ivy or the one where Harley accidentally steals a dress.

Camerawork is great and they made it look visually as appealing as they could but the lack of originality takes a lot of emotion away from this film.\n\n\nIf they wanted to do another Harley Quinn movie why not just call it Quinn or Harley and do exactly what they just did minus the whole politically driven agenda and forcing a \"Birds of Prey\" narrative that clearly isn't there.

I am person with a passionate interest in cinema. I am not paid to write review's it is one of my many hobbies.\r\n As a red-blooded American man,  I saw this film opening night. Margot Robbie is a wonder as Harley Quinn, and she manages to bring a glorious sense of fun to her morally questionable and selfish anti-hero. While the violence doesn't necessarily seem like it deserves an R-rating IMO , aside from a scene or two , the energy that Director: Cathy Yan creates manages to make this all work in the end. It's certainly not perfect, but with a ton of bright spots - including an ode to Marilyn Monroe.\r\n Self-aware, in your face and refusing to apologize for it, D.C.

He's a control freak as a result of his insecurities and often emotionally manipulated by his right hand man, who sees Black Canary as a threat and therefore tries to blacklist her. It's all there to be honest.\n\nAs far as the plot being \"simple\" I think that's a good thing. The movie is told from Harley's perspective, so it's not going to be linear and will be HEAVILY stylized.

Harley Quinn doesn‚Äôt show up or is a victim when they‚Äôre doing a darker story with Joker.\n\nYes the tone does matter.

Let me explain this for you. Harley Quinn is a sexualize cute character that's who she is. She's also evil. Or perhaps a better term would be a Amoral She kills children. She's supposed to be a cuter more funny version of the Joker. But more dangerous more crazy legitimately legally insane and has killed multiple children. This woke nonsense about her being a role model is like saying Hannibal Lecter would be a role model. And it's not Harley Quinn. Harley Quinn killed a bunch of kids in Goffin with explosives in video games just because she wanted them die for the chaos. She beat a 10 year old boy with baseball bat breaking multiple bones. She is a villain you idiots. She's legitimately evil. In fact, it's kind of sexist for you to portray her as a good hero... She isn't just cute. She's an evil monster. Yes, she does good things occasionally completely randomly. Because she is crazy. That is the point of the character. She supposed to be a better more evil version of the Joker. But Done Right often she does good things. This confuses a lot of people. But it's really simple. She doesn't really understand the consequences of her actions. She really is criminally insane. She'll take a baby and throw it into a compost machine Smile as it dies and say \"well it'll be okay. After I wake up tomorrow after the next reboot\". Because she doesn't understand. She breaks the fourth wall because she thinks she's in a comic book. Because she really is crazy not because she is right that she is in a comic book. She thinks everything is a dream. So nothing she does matters. She acts completely without consequence. And without conscience. The character you are portraying is not the character Fans like.. She doesn't have the secret good heart and keep trying to write her with. Not when the characters done, right. She is a villain. End of story But not completely the end. PS she's also sexy and cute. And completely innocent. Even though she kills the baby while her mother screams and begs for her child's life. Harley Quinn doesn't get it. She thinks it's all just temporary. Nothing is real to Harley She's just as crazy as the Joker. Maybe more so.", "cid": "Ugysm2030yXnEpEoOJN4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

What I didn't like was the R rating, while doing the PG goofy jokes. I'd LOVE to see a movie with Harley and The Crossbow Killer! Those 2 were great! Rosie Perez was boring AF and the Black Canary had potential but nothing was done with her. The sexual assault the bad guy was into didn't need to be there and the fight scenes were often ridiculous and unrealistic (not Harley's acrobatics, that was good, but the police are a joke and some of the 'hits' didn't have much impact). Margot just seemed to have rubbish to work with. Give her another chance, please! Anyways, that's my review in a nutshell.

There's a constant switching back and forth over long periods to tell DP's excellent origin story. And there's little character building, except for DP - what did we really learn about Colossus or NTW or the villains? They are just there to further DP's strong story and reflect his wit, yet they are brilliant characters without trying hard. Same idea as Harley but in the Marvel universe, everything just works.

Call me crazy, but I don't have any desire to support a film that believes I am an evil prick on the basis that I'm a man. This is precisely the reason I didn't want to go see the Black Christmas remake, both of these films, from what I've heard on basically all accounts are man-hating feminist propaganda. Let's be clear here, I'm fine with a female lead, I'm fine with a non-sexualized female lead, what I'm not fine with is a film saying \"Well, men are garbage, but give me your money anyway\". To be clear, I like Wonder Woman, and even Captain Marvel (a film from my understanding not a lot of people did like, but I found it entertaining). What did those films do right that this film has done wrong you may inquire? ü§îü§îü§î Well, could it be that somehow those films managed to be entertaining films without shoving a stupid political message down people's throats that about 90 per cent of the country doesn't agree with??? I wonder ü§î? Could that be it ü§î? I'm just not sure. Hollywood needs to learn that people don't like being preached at, especially when that preaching is portraying half of the population as evil woman hating douche bags to appease the angry blue haired Twitter mob brandishing their pitch forks and torches while they get triggered because your movie isn't woke enough, but then that same Twitter mob gets all pissed off when people don't go to see their feminist film, because turns out, not a lot of people are willing to pay to be called a misogynist. This film looks like an entertaining film, and when I eventually see it (more than likely not in theaters, but in some kind of home media after the price has gone down drastically from the original price), it will probably entertain me for the most part, but I garuntee every \"men suck\" line will have me rolling my eyes, and wondering to myself why Hollywood just can't take the hint that people don't like having \"wokeness\" shook in their face like an annoying maraca without rythm. In this case, people are speaking with their wallets, just as they did with the \"woke\" Charlie's Angels\" reboot, and the \"woke\" Black Christmas remake. Make no mistake, although I anticipate being highly annoyed by this films decision to shove its politics down my throat, I'm still very much so hoping I find it entertaining!", "cid": "UgxoE03Zepua1Xxewjt4AaABAg.94qlZNDYtDT94wBW9GVRSh", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Not to mention if someone were to come out before the film and someone from the film were to say, women this isn't for you, stay home, girls, this one's just for the guys!

I told you, I'm going to see the film eventually, and when I do, I will judge it fairly, because believe it or not, I like comic book movies, and I would like to enjoy this film. I am not on a mission to dislike them, but when a film has been preachy in the past, I've been able to pick up on it. It's not a very subtle thing in Hollywood when they're trying to deliver an agenda to you. By the way, saying watching a film's trailer is \"judging a book by the cover\" is not accurate. That is literally judging bits of a film that they throw together to make you want to see the full film, that's why there's a bit more creedance to someone watching a trailer and saying \"man that movie looks like ass\", over someone looking at a film's poster and saying \"that film looks like ass\". Oh, and by the way, that initial thought of \"this movie looks like it's going to be super preachy\" is a thought of my own, just because I'm listening to those who confirm that initial thought that I have doesn't mean I don't think for myself, as the initial suspicion literally required thought, and opinion on my end, you may want to think out your insults a wee bit better in the future.", "cid": "UgxoE03Zepua1Xxewjt4AaABAg.94qlZNDYtDT94x3LJRWiAU", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Now, if there were \"men suck\" lines, and every other second Captain Marvel was bitching about men, and saying \"yay woman power\", I honestly don't remember it that way, now, I do remember Bri Larson saying some douchie shit before the movie came out, but I don't remember quite what that was. Bottom line, I garuntee if it had the same problems, I was rolling my eyes every time they presented themselves, but from what I remember of that film, I don't remember a ton of feminism shit. For the record, I actually prefer DC as a company, as far as their characters go, but that doesn't mean they're immune to making mistakes. My three favorite films of all time are Batman (1989), The Dark Knight, and Joker, plus I defended Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, and even Justice League, so I must say, this is the first time I've been called a Marvel fanboy üòÇ.

Why does a woman need to show off her body?\n\nDo you think I am a dumbass dimwit feminazi for asking a simple question? Why are you so sensitive? \n\nWhy do you think I think men should be attracted to all women? Where did I write that?

It cheapens the movie and is used to mask plot holes and more. \n\nI get that teenage boys will be too focused on some skin to notice but people who think with their other body parts will notice.\n\nDo you think Margot is less attractive when she isn't half naked?\n\nShe's a very beautiful woman. She doesn't need to degrade or objectify herself to look gorgeous.\n\nAnd before you get into your feminazi drivel, understand that feminists are the ones rooting for Slut Walks, glorifying promiscuous behavior, walking around half naked and calling it empowering etc. while conservative women are those who believe that women should have class, dignity and self respect.\n\nThere, helped you out with your lashing out.üòÑüòÇ So, when you're angry you can call me a dumbass dimwit self respecting, classy conservative üòÇüòÜ\n\nAnd thirdly, it's okay for people to have different opinions.

However for your soft soul I will speak in a more appropriate manner.\n      Second My question still remains why is it bad when a women wears revealing costumes/clothes in certain television shows ? After all there is nothing wrong with showing some skin. Why is it always degrading ? No one forced these women to take these roles. Also why do we have to change things that are already made to fit an agenda. For eg the costumes for superheroes and villains male or female the costumes are a bit revealing so what why is that bad ?   \n      Third I do agree that in other cases nudity or oversexualization occurs in television and movies and yes it is to hide plot holes and such . these are generally movies that are made for a quick laugh like teen flicks and rom coms among others.  \n        Fourth  No I do not think Margot Robbie needs to be half naked to be beautiful or any women for that matter I just don't see all the big fuss and why it's always looked at as a bad thing and degrading. It's not a big deal it is 2020 not 1950 and people make way to big a deal about stupid little things and it gets a we bit sickening at times. \n       Fifth Maybe I was a we bit harsh in my first comment, however I do not believe the way one chooses to express oneself should act as a result to there intelligence. But I will apologize for being rash with my statement hopefully this comes across in a more appropriate manner. \n\n\nP.S Lastly not sure what young is to you but I am almost 35 maam and I was raised by a we little phrase goes something like this \"Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me \" Something I feel society has forgotten somewhere along the way. Not saying that some people aren't out of hand at times but for the majority of the time \"turn the other cheek\"comes to mind. Me I don't got time to be offended over every little thing.", "cid": "UgyZIEMKMR7EULE_vv94AaABAg.94pwndPRgW894yA5cuMT9z", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

That's kind of you.\n\nWe have different starting points on the question of revealing clothing. If I understand correctly, for you it's not degrading for a woman to titillate men with her body. For me, the last thing I would do is to titillate men I have nothing to do with as that kid of attention is unappealing to any self respecting woman. But opinions are like assholes, everybody has one.\n\nAnd I will assert that I don't think the costume Margot originally wore was over the top even through it certainly was revealing but I can understand her clothing is meaningful to people who are emotionally involved in these types of movies and that they didn't appreciate the changes.\n\nAgain, we disagree on nudity. Just because society had classier values in the 1950s and today it's fine for women to rub their crotches while singing doesn't mean things have improved. In my opinion they have downgraded heavily and it's showing in many different aspects of modern culture all over the modern world.\n\nI didn't mind you being harsh in your initial comment as much as I objected to the strawman arguments and mislabelling me as a feminist. I did get a chuckle out of the phrasing, no harsh feelings on my end but I thought I was communicating with a very young man, who thinks women that see things differently are necessarily modern feminists. I think it's very nice of you to apologize and I appreciate that very much. Thank you.\n\nAnd by young I presumed a teenager or early 20s. It turns out we're closer in age than I thought as I just turned 39.\n\nI agree with you that words shouldn't be considered so offensive and that people are much too sensitive nowadays. I do hope it was clear that my response to you was in jest partially, when I referred to the labels you used.üòâ\n\nI'll try to summarize. I don't think there is anything wrong with a woman being aware of her beauty and attractiveness. That is natural and normal. Women too often have self esteem issues and think they're not pretty enough. I was like that all throughout my 20s where I arguably looked much better than today. But when that feminine beauty and appeal are downgraded to vulgarity and crudeness I don't think that's right. Movies have a massive effect on people, especially young people. \n\nI understand preserving a character in its natural form matters to people.\n\nBut I don't think the outfit matters nearly as much as the character's personality. If she remains true to herself matters so much more, clothes changing to more modest isn't a bad thing in my opinion.\n\nTo conclude I know we disagree on this but I appreciate your respectful tone. I don't claim I'm always respectful, far from it. My tone usually matches the tone of the person I'm communicating with and I can be very harsh myself.\n\nAll the best.", "cid": "UgyZIEMKMR7EULE_vv94AaABAg.94pwndPRgW894yd8R0VXLA", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Some might call that shallow, but I think it was more a case of Margot Robbie and the crew behind it knowing exactly what the audience wanted. Similar to old Arnie movies, its fun to just turn your brain off, sit back with popcorn, and enjoy the mayhem.\n\n\nCompare to, say, Batman vs Superman, which tried to take the material seriously. Or Justice League, for trying to ape Avengers/Marvel. Birds of Prey is just an enjoyable romp and doesn't have any aspirations of being anything else, and that's why it works really well. Could it be stronger? Of course. Was it bad? Not at all.", "cid": "UgxNHtSUpXZM8ER9T8J4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

It‚Äôs the scene where he‚Äôs trying to sway someone to bring his associates into the fold. Yes, there are a few characters that don‚Äôt get much if any characterization, but with a cast and a limited time as it has to tell the story in the frantic pace as such is expected. There‚Äôs enough information and scenes that do make you side with them. Montoya is the detective that is used by other men on the force for their benefit. Black Canary knows the price of fighting crime because of her mother and chooses to hide, but has a crisis of conscience when a little girl, who has parents that are aggressive and possibly violent toward one another which Cassandra‚Äôs way of escape is pickpocketing. While Huntress is mostly vacant and emotionless, her backstory expresses her numbness, but she warms up when she has something to fight for that isn‚Äôt revenge. Sometimes, I think we see different movies. As for Joker, my issues are because of the exploitation‚Äôs and glorification of a mentally ill person‚Äôs delusions. Yes, Deadpool and Harley Quinn are terrible Murders, but these movies are not serious and often silly. Joker was extremely serious and during a time where mass shooters‚Äô excuse, by the media, is that they are mentally ill. Also, Joker is just wishy washy on everything. Aspects of bigger picture issues are established but don‚Äôt really mean anything because the movie being told through the eyes of the central character. I don‚Äôt think that the narration was excessive at all in Birds of Prey. It kept a consistent style and voice. I think you overthink this rather than a movie like Joker when this just fun, dark comedy that was generated by the likes that Deadpool brought. Tone and storytelling do alter how a movie is received. I thought this was a fun movie. It‚Äôs not gunning for Oscars, but it has a fresh spirit about it that makes it great to watch again, not punishing.", "cid": "Ugyd12EEwjP15wjelrF4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

She's absolutely a horrible person, and in interviews Margot has said she would push back when Yan was taken away with making Harley too sympathetic. But due to her history, Harley does become sympathetic, even though she is a murderer. Meanwhile, anything sympathetic about the Joker from the movie is marked questionable due to highly unreliable narration.\nAgain, love that you brought this up. Its a fascinating thought!", "cid": "Ugz5G9ogmZDaWFWRhBh4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

The characters are very fun throughout the whole movie. Siones‚Äô problems with his family could‚Äôve been better fleshed out along with dinah, but the other characters are given purpose and drive to their actions. The comedy hits most of the time with there being some low points along with those high points. I will agree the beginning of the movie has sub-par pacing and kind of takes you out of it until the second and third act hits. The plot is also basic which is a downside but it‚Äôs not bad necessarily just basic. That being said we are given great actions, good team chemistry, over the top dialogue, acceptable humor, and overall a fun atmosphere. Is it perfect? No not at all. Is it a C+? I don‚Äôt believe so it seems more like a solid B rating movie. It has issues but none of them are glaring enough to bring it down to a B. Just my opinion I enjoyed the video nonetheless", "cid": "UgzcgF7WT80qtT4Hf6l4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Birds of Prey definitely isn't one of DC's worst, but it isn't their best movie either. Sort-of an in-between. It's a fun movie, but it has a lot of flaws. My dad's not a comic book fan (He just likes batman), but Deadpool was enjoyable for him, when he went to see birds of prey with me for my birthday lol.... He had to literally endure through it without walking out of the theater. He even mentioned to me how surprising it is that Birds of Prey isn't PG 13 since the gore is nowhere near the same level as Deadpool 1 and 2.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I enjoyed this movie for what it was, but comparing it to Marvel's comedic R-rated film, it's nowhere near as good.", "cid": "UgxFQVckcuO6oaIL4KB4AaABAg.94mhqKsCcHn95KDBfr2bEk", "time": "3Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

So it's not always apparent when someone IS being sarcastic because if you go by the usual standard of debate on YouTube you'd wouldn't put it past a seemingly sarcastic poster to actually be serious.\n\nSo it's a bit harsh to call people idiots for not picking up on sarcasm. That comment about the Joker film didn't come across as sarcastic to me, either. He said \"Joker was a bad film\" which is a subjective opinion, before going on to justify why he said that. So it was a perfectly sensible reaction to take the poster at his word and think he was being sincere because he started with a serious opinion about the film. Suddenly switching to sarcasm halfway through your comment before switching back to genuine opinion towards the end is just confusing and is bound to get people thinking you're either being genuine or sarcastic.\n\nI hate sarcasm.

But they do give us a lot of things to work with from the other characters, and I for one found myself really caring about the Birds of Prey (Montoya, Huntress, Canary) at the end of it. Their dynamic is fun and feels fresh, and I do think that they are a strong team of characters. The plot might be basic, but I think that the characters make it work. I love this take on Huntress especially. Everyone really shines in their performance and it just brings the whole movie together for me.

Her Suicide Squad file confirms she was an \"accomplice to the murder of Robin\" (presumably Jason Todd), whom Ben Affleck's Batman grieved over losing.\r\n\r\nNot being quite as monstrous as another monster doesn't make you any less of one. Joaquin Phoenix's Joker was unapologetic in his mayhem, he was never made out to be some likable antihero.\r\n\r\nYes, he's victimized and inspires others but it's made clear that he's not a good person and has no qualms by the finale with horrid acts. He's the hero of his own story, but stays true to the character.\r\n\r\nOne main reason many still root for him is because the plot & writing from his pov are so well done. Birds of Prey, even in its marketing, tried too hard to make Harley a redeemable loose cannon imo. \r\n\r\nEven in Suicide Squad, it felt as if the studio was unwilling to commit to her & Joker's setup in Batman v Superman because they feared such a brutal character would deter viewers' investment.\r\n\r\nInstead, they attempted a soft retcon of her buildup, presenting this Guardians of the Galaxy- style comedic renegade who was just another victim of Joker's abuse and learns the value of friendship.\r\n\r\nIt all came off very disingenuous to me, like the DCEU simply backpedaled on a faithful portrayal of Harley Quinn because (shocker) they were worried about her movies not selling enough.", "cid": "UgyAq4XgFjAn5bgA0Ih4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

She's ALWAYS been abused by him.\" Agreed, I never said or implied otherwise. \r\n\r\nMy point was, they used her victimization at Joker's hands as a plot device to discourage her from personal responsibility or agency. If I didn't convey that well, my apologies.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Harley's abuse wasn't just an organic piece of storytelling to explain her background. Suicide Squad twisted her victimization from Joker into an excuse for sympathy.\r\n\r\nThis was an obvious tactic by the writers to emotionally manipulate audiences, encouraging a more forgiving attitude toward her in spite of her past actions by barely referencing them. \r\n\r\nThat's one reason her introductory criminal file (like the other characters) was skimmed through so fast, because too much detail about their crimes would risk lessening likability.\r\n\r\nThey even tried to cut down on Killer Croc's intimidation factor, making him into another likable abuse victim (of society, for his appearance) and giving him jokes.\r\n\r\nHis cannibalism is glossed over like a superficial note. This is a pattern throughout the film, little-no attention being paid to the innocents these characters have hurt.\r\n\r\nIt's no accident that they never kill a single person most would sympathize with onscreen. The only one portrayed as legitimately evil is (gasp) Enchantress, the antagonist.", "cid": "UgyAq4XgFjAn5bgA0Ih4AaABAg.94krfO5kRPf94peWHd8EWq", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

This strategy isn't new in storytelling.\r\n\r\nThis is most apparent in how Jared Leto's Joker displays some subtle but sincere feelings for Harley (Hence, why he goes back to help her instead of saving himself).\r\n\r\nNo other version of Joker I know of does this, and it fundamentally changes his character. Joker always saw Harley as a means to an end, making her love for him that much sadder.\r\n\r\nThe difference is, Harley wasn't originally treated as an antihero. In the animated Batman series, she consistently refuses help, enjoys hurting others, and does reprehensible things.\r\n\r\nThose depictions didn't shy away from spotlighting what makes her a villain.

For me, Birds of Prey deserved a better than passing grade, my choice is B-. The minus is due to the movie's short length resulting in the lack of backstory or dialogue for some of the secondary character and the primary villain.

I thought it was brilliantly acted by everyone, (Oscars for Margot and Ewan) the cinematography was awesome, choreography fun, sound and score great and the plot while sure not original, fit the film.

The movie used a lot of shorthand to make people see common and relatable issues that each woman faced. Even the weakest character with the least screentime is fun because once we see more of them they're so damn entertaining that it makes up for it. As for Ewan McGregor as Black Mask, yeah he's over the top and not very developed, but again, it's shorthand, and it's a caricature of the kinds of people I see all the time. I won't say it's a perfect film. The voice-over did get annoying, and the beginning is hard to follow, but once it got moving I had a blast.

A lot of movies have \"the heroes\" shooting/blowing up things without showing if civilians are affected. John Wick shooting in that club could easily kill a bystander.

It's a drama, not an action comedy. The film language associated with each genre makes a difference, no?\n\nAs for for the villain: Not even talking about this movie, but in general, can we not have a villain with no motivation other than being a jerk anymore?

I know he isn‚Äôt the antagonist but he is a symbol of it. Also they try to dive into mental health doesn‚Äôt work.

So, if they show me Harley as a \"crazy\" girl who does \"crazy\" things, I'm going to be disappointed with the movie, Harley must be a villain, a psycho killer that we better fear. The worst thing about Suicide Squad for me was justly this point, I don't want a Killer Croc that can make jokes, I want a Killer Croc that eats people. You know what I mean? Harley and Black Mask could still fight each other for any reason while remaining two homicidal maniacs. Anyway, that's only my opinion.", "cid": "UgydEM9r0gZpJiuQqOF4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Arthur is portrayed as a mentally ill guy who can't get a girlfriend, loses his job, just hates his life, and decides to murder a bunch of people. You know, the kind of person incel circles have been churning out faster than marvel makes new superhero films. It, whether it wants to or not, directly mirrors the state some people are in in our society right now, and glorifies it, even though their mental state often results in murder. Of course people are gonna be scared of that, especially the living relatives of the victims of people like Arthur. Can you imagine your family member getting murdered by some psychopath only for someone to make a movie where that kind of psychopath is glorified? I loved joker, don't get me wrong, but come on man.\n\n\nBirds of prey does not take itself seriously. At all. No fucking cheerleader is gonna go insane and shoot people with blue and red confetti.

Harley Quinn has always been a character audiences are meant to sympathize and even root for, because despite all of the horrible things she‚Äôs done there is still good in her. She isn‚Äôt evil, just manipulated to think that she is. There was also always a level of fantasy with Harley that naturally makes you treat her differently. With the Joker, especially modern interpretations of the character where we have driven him to a spot where he is meant to be viewed through the lens of reality, we should not feel bad for him. Even if we know what his reasonings are for doing horrible things, the story always made it clear that he is not to be pitied or identified with. With the Joker movie, you can make the argument that they don‚Äôt apologize for his actions or want you to sympathize with him, but it must be true to some extent because he is the protagonist of the film. People understandably have a hard time with that, specifically because all of the truly evil things he‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs just too hard to look past.", "cid": "UgwySWRyPO6L-PB3TmN4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

Yes. \nBut reducing to her a thief? What the everloving fuck?\nCassandra Cain is the daughter of Lady Shiva and David Cain. She was seen as a weapon and was never taught to speak any language. Her father used her as an experiment to teach her a language that's spoken through martial arts and she was used as an assassin as a child. She'd be brought up to someone and told to say \"Hello\" and in doing so she'd kill them. So her having to be \"saved\" by the Birds of Prey in this is ENTIRELY horseshit. She was brought up to be the bodyguard of Ras Al Ghul! The leader of the League of Assassins!\nEventually she runs into Barbra Gordon who does her best to teach her how to speak english and allows her to take on the mantle of Batgirl.\nCassandra realizes what her parents are making her do is evil and she runs away from the life of killing to become a hero.\nSo hearing that she's reduced to a thief that has to be saved after waiting so many years to see her on screen is just a hard \"fuck you movie.\" from me.", "cid": "UgxskS03kHRINstWyO94AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

An opinion isn‚Äôt something you can write off as wrong, especially if it isn‚Äôt your own. And while you can say that maybe he hasn‚Äôt seen the movie, why assume that? And how can you prove it.

You don‚Äôt know if he has or hasn‚Äôt and you asked that without having a reason to question that in the first place. That doesn‚Äôt look good. In fact, it looks like you are trying to make him be silent rather than asking why he would think that. I‚Äôm not saying this is what you are trying to do, and I can understand where you are coming from, but know that‚Äôs how it looks if you were to approach with that mindset. His opinions are his, and yours are yours. Neither are wrong as they are right. They are the way we think, and his is just as valid as yours considering we have no reason to believe he hasn‚Äôt seen the movie.", "cid": "UgzmZAXyFxtVdPEPcIJ4AaABAg.94jprG9Y7RN94l2AQ7D_Zq", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

But saying that someone thinking he is is not wrong. That‚Äôs what they think. I doubt that would happen, but if we are taking your extreme case, you are arguing that what someone is thinking, even if it doesn‚Äôt have a basis in reality, is wrong. Which you can‚Äôt do. You don‚Äôt know why they would think that, but that‚Äôs what they think so that isn‚Äôt wrong.\nYou are arguing that people use wrong opinions (which you did not argue how an opinion can be wrong, you only proved you wished to discredit said opinion) to bully others. Problem is, that‚Äôs what your doing. You are saying that their opinions are wrong yet again, to undermine an agenda. Because of this, you view one opinion right and one wrong. There are only two reasons I can think for you do this. \nOne: you are attempting to demonize the side you disagree with. In doing so, you are saying that you are right, and they are wrong. That isn‚Äôt true as many people may not like the movie, and that is just as valid because of what I explained in my previous comment. Spreading that opinion, using the lens that you are right and they are wrong, is often viewed as bullying others into said correct opinion by undermining the value of the views of the other side. In my opinion, this is very disingenuous.\nTwo: you view your opinion as fact. This can not be true because there is no definite proof that your opinion is more factual or valuable than others. But it‚Äôs the same thing, you are making your own importance higher, and the importance of the opposition lower to discredit or switch them. Which is bullying or manipulation respectively. Again, I see that as very disingenuous. Especially since your opinion is in no way special enough to be viewed as fact. Your mindset is not the same as others and a failure to respect that usually leads to bullying of others into the opinions you have. \nUnfortunately, that is no better than what you denounce. Regardless of agenda, no opinion is wrong or false since it‚Äôs the views of another that you can not control. Their opinion are theirs and yours are yours. Because of that very nature, you can not say an opinion is false or wrong the same way no one can say your views are wrong. And it is very disingenuous to attempt to discredit any opinion that you view different than yours.", "cid": "UgzmZAXyFxtVdPEPcIJ4AaABAg.94jprG9Y7RN94l604rt7Wa", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

I figured you were trying to say that how someone interprets events, even in the cases of extreme insanity, can be wrong, not the events themselves, but how they are interpreted, and I would argue that is not the case. The reason I thought this is that I figured you were not going to use an objective situation to try to prove your point since it does nothing. But that‚Äôs seems like that‚Äôs exactly what you are trying to do. Why? That doesn‚Äôt help you. That‚Äôs an objective point. The only argument with that is ‚Äúwas Alexander a president or not?‚Äù You can‚Äôt form an opinion on that. There is yes and no and one can be proven. An objective point of view can be wrong, but we are talking about subjectivity here. This doesn‚Äôt really support anything you have said. I even figured you were trying to talk about subjectivity in the way that this could be interpreted, but since that‚Äôs clearly not the case, you can‚Äôt even have an opinion on this matter. It‚Äôs an objective situation, which is not what we were talking about in the first place. \nWhile there are people that bully with their opinions, that does not make their opinions wrong. My point was that attempting to brand  opinions as wrong is the same thing, and I was using you as an example. You also state that OP has the disingenuous opinion, yet this is because you assume he has it because of an agenda. Which you do not know, since all he has stated is that he doesn‚Äôt like it. You also do not know that his opinion is disingenuous at all since you assume it is, yet you don‚Äôt know that. All he said was that he didn‚Äôt like the movie. You have no way to know that he is disingenuous or that he is being so because of agenda. You assumed that. Most of my previous comment was to show that if you are against him, and you truly know he‚Äôs disingenuous, branding him as having a wrong opinion is just as disingenuous, and I went into detail as to why. I never stated you hated him. But you did state that his opinion is wrong, and you seemed to have assumed that he was disingenuous without knowing that for sure. Doing so leads to the other side being right, and based on the only thing that his comment is, that would be that the movie is good. If you say that him saying the movie is bad is wrong, than the opposite of that, the right, is that the movie is good. Considering there is nothing else to his comment, I can not think of another reason why you would say his comment is wrong, especially since you can not prove he has that opinion because of an agenda. \nI didn‚Äôt say you hate the OP, but since you have stated that the OP is disingenuous without a valid reason why, it does not seem the tactics you disagree with are in play. While a bit brash on my part, I would assume your opinion to be opposite of his due to how quickly you are willing to discredit him based on assumptions you have no way of proving. Like I said, this is brash and jumping to conclusions, and for that, I apologize. But I would also like to know why you are so quick to discredit someone that just says they don‚Äôt like the movie using claims of being disingenuous without anything to prove that is what he is doing.", "cid": "UgzmZAXyFxtVdPEPcIJ4AaABAg.94jprG9Y7RN94lCAdHj5DR", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Getting back to Alexander Hamilton.  People offer opinions everyday that are factually incorrect, but they firmly believe they have that opinion.  Why?  Because they haven't found out yet that they are factually incorrect.  People will say, \"You are entitled to your opinion.\"  However, it's no longer an opinion once it proven to be wrong.

In fact, the tone of that movie makes that fact even more disturbingly true. Harley, by comparison, is frankly only slightly unhinged, and is currently more of an antihero even in the comics.

Either it being her mother who was a villainous version of Huntress before her being a heroic turn, or the her being the daughter of Batman and Catwoman deal. Either way, her issues are always family related and always about her mother or father being at odds with her methods.\n\n\nBlack Canary's literal arc is that her mother was Canary before her and doesn't want to see her daughter live that life, so she has to be trained by a family friend in secret.\n\n\nOr you know, comics, they're full of family drama...who would have guessed.

Birds Of Prey advertises itself as a movie where everyone is special and each individual to look forward too if you read the comics or aware of these characters before film. For comic book characters you hope they have more time to shine than the most known ones. Harry Potter side characters are woven together to the main characters obstacles and stories.

Nothing to get triggered: \"you're triggered aren't? go find a safe space snowflake.\", you however seem triggered enough to not be able to even write a semi-proper sentence, just relax pal, it will be ok, but please, don't project your insecurities on me. I can disagree with someone without getting triggered or in need of a safe place. And you are certainly not bringing up any \"issues\" most people don't already know, you are just too arrogant to think you know better, or that others don't care; and you are wrong in both accounts; you just insult people on the internet, just as much a troll as the alt-right; pretty much the same as them, just different perspective, you both think you know better and are ready to go to extremes to impose your will. And please don't talk in the plural, you don't represent anything, just your self, certainly not social justice. You are making the work of actually useful people in the field so much harder with your childish behaviour.", "cid": "UgxCe2rb2-LUQe8eDVd4AaABAg.94jY8_EIBqN94l04nU5VOT", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

Marvel films have always come out close to one another. People flocked to see Captain Marvel thinking it had a role to play in the final movie. \n\nAlso, I'd like you point out where someone in this thread has aggressively shit on progressive film. People are expressing skepticism because Hollywood prefers heavy-handed trendy messages that beat you senselessly over the head. They're afraid people will miss the point which is what happened to Joker. Instead of focusing on the messages of poverty and mental illness, the media focused on the fact that Joker was a white male. Hundreds of articles shit talking both the movie and Joaquin Phoenix who was just playing a fictional character. They accused the film of encouraging mass shooters(even though the media is silent on Harley Quinn) so much so the director had to come out and spell it out for the journalistic vultures. You can be upset about anti-SJW shit, but you're burying your head in the sand if you can't see why people would be worried.", "cid": "UgxCe2rb2-LUQe8eDVd4AaABAg.94jY8_EIBqN94m3UG4BLbS", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

No matter the excuse people use. You can dislike it and critize it if you want, but it was a success.\nAnd did I said that I was referring to someone in this thread? I just said that I was going to rant about how the \"SJW\" term lost all meaning to me after being used as a justification to be angry at anything progressive at all. Why did I do that? Well... I felt inspired to after seeing how this comment chain went to shit.\nLike I said, If a movie has a gay or black character it will get backlash because \"it's SJW propaganda!\" almost guaranteed no matter the context. And nowadays that even happens with movies with female protagonists. Again, Wonder Woman had a similar backlash to Captain Marvel pre-release. Probably smaller due to the fact that the film was smaller (nothing against Wonder Woman, but Captain Marvel had a bigger push at the time)\nI am not saying that it is good for movies to have a forced progressive message. In fact, I dislike how Hollywood tries to go \"yeah guys, look! we are progressive!\" by doing stuff like two background characters (easily removable in foreign versions of the film) be gay. But at some point the \"SJW propaganda!!!!\" stuff feels more like an excuse.\n\nEdit: another reason why I felt inspired to make that comment was because I just saw a small niche Japanese game be bombarded with bad reviews because it has A conversation where it said that people from the LGTB group are good.

The only difference is... well, there is no difference; you just seem to think that because it is you that does the labelling then it is ok. You are doing what those you think you are against do, you just give yourself a pass.\n\n\nSecondly, by taking your opinion as an absolute truth, you deny others their right to think, express themselves, exchange opinions be wrong, and possibly learn, be right and possibly teach (even teach you). And you are creating a very bad image for people that actually care about social justice. People welcome information, because they are programmed to use it; they despise virtue-signaling, preaching, bullying and arrogance, because it deprives them of their ability to function as human beings. Which is why social justice efforts have taken such a big hit in recent times. Feminism for example used to be something I was so glad to be a part of, but now I can't even say it without taking an absurd amount of time to explain the difference between those seeking equality and those being assholes to men; because what most people from the outside see are the extremists that behave like idiots and think every feminist is like that. And your attitude doesn't help. You could have said something about Captain Marvel being a flawed (perhaps) but important step in women becoming more involved in cinema. Since you are so big on social justice, I would have thought you would be first and foremost aware of your responsibility to make things better not worse; \"do no harm\" as we say in my field.

In this movie, there‚Äôs just not enough of that. Suicide Squad was a mess but by having Will Smith as Deadshot, they managed to have a bit of balance between the sane and the crazy. Smith and Robbie made Suicide Squad watchable and I‚Äôm hoping Idris Elba brings the same level of sanity to Suicide Squad 2. I think a little of Harley goes a long way.

John does not rebut this, and instead just says \"let's talk about something productive instead\". That monologue? It's the monologue that's done when the film-maker has a message for the audience. And the franchise as a whole had a \"women are the future\" message, since John would be nothing without his mother, which is a big theme in the first one.\nYou can have problems with how Black Mask was written, but don't act like the agenda behind him is anything new or noteworthy.

That type of violence and those kinds of tragedies (mass shootings, and other forms of domestic terrorism) are tragedies we are faced with on an almost daily basis at this point. It can be difficult, I think, to \"enjoy\" that type of violence or to see it as just entertainment when it's so real to you, when/if it's something you might worry about on a daily basis. \n\nWhereas Harley Quinn clearly does not take place in our real world just based on the tone and the visual language of the movie. It's over the top, silly and cartoonish. It doesn't feel real and it's not trying to be a major indictment on or hold up a mirror to society the way that Joker is. So one is silly and therefore enjoyable and the other one is more realistic and might hit too close to home. And to be fair, Joker isn't trying to be \"entertaining\", it's a movie that's criticizing the ways in which society is lacking or is failing certain groups of people, namely those with significant mental health struggles, so it makes sense that people would engage with it in a different way than a fantasy romp a la Birds of Prey.", "cid": "Ugze-GF8UcVgo2pgqV54AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

I didn't hate Joker but people had very valid reasons concerning that film and it's \"empathy\" narrative. BOP literally never asks you to have sympathy for Harley. It is still clearly established that she has zero issues with backstabbing, murder,violence, stealing etc. and that she's overall still a morally ambiguous character and makes no attempt to amend that. There isn't some big \"FEEL BAD FOR ME\" storyline.¬†\n The point about the chemical plant doesn't make much sense either because you said it yourself that her mind is constant chaos and it's clearly mentioned she is drunk when that happened so of course she wasn't thinking about chemical plant workers! ¬†\nThe main difference between the two is that at the end of Joker, lots of innocent people got killed/hurt as the result of Arthur's actions. In BOP correct me if I'm wrong but the only people who Harley killed/hurt were other criminals? BOP wasn't a perfect film but don't create controversy where there isn't.", "cid": "UgyivoHo5O34ox3zymR4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Seriously. What point is it trying to make with the characters and their actions? If that doesn't concern you then just play video games. Much more immersive and you get to see essentially the same thing: Physics-defying, cardboard characters making things explode. Women punching out men may be a fantasy of some misogynists but it isn't reality in even the slightest. Having the protagonist shoot actors wearing police costumes, again, maybe a fantasy of some anarchists but is ludicrous as both a plot point and as something filmmakers should be promoting to younger audiences. Like, who's making these movies and for what purpose other than a cash grab by millionaires. The movie itself really is the point, I guess. It's the hypocrisy of Hollywood pretending to stand for one thing while laughing in your face at your gullibility for paying for this garbage. One thing's for sure, until people stop watching this garbage there will be much more of it coming down the pike.", "cid": "UgzaWKq6VC85tk1oDYJ4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

So they rush their fully fleshed out characters in their head so the movie won't belong. Then they are all united to fight the big boy bad guy with ten minutes left in the movie.

And WHY IS HARLEY QUINN THE MAIN FOCUS WHEN THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE IS BIRDS OF PREY?", "cid": "Ugz5zlVk0Xbj-z7N4P54AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

That would require writing and creativity. With this they only had to look at the cover of a comic book, gather around a couple C list characters around her and beat on an unlikable shitbag and Warner already hands the \"LOOK HOW WOKE WE ARE!\" receipt to the audience.

I don't know about it being woke yet because I didn't look through all the spoilers, but the ones I did read about the characters is that they aren't handled well.

Especially since he killed a person who was trying to help him at the end of the movie.\n\nI dont have a problem with people complaining about a movie being woke.

For comic readers, the ending of the film would imply that the movie was just another one of the hundreds of made up back stories the Joker tells his victims in comics before manipulating or killing them. The comics themselves flat out say it multiple times, the Joker isn't crazy, he's just evil. Of course a story told by the most unreliable and evil narrator would portray going insane from trauma as liberating. That's how he manipulated people like Harley Quinn to begin with. He just did it to the audience this time. If the audience moral compass is so broken, then that's on them. Art shouldn't be crippled or dumbed down just because people aren't mature enough to comprehend it properly. The worst to come out of the Joker movie was cringe memes with Arthur Fleck featuring virgin quotes he never even said in the movie.\n\nAnd it's understandable why people would think the BOP movie is agenda driven based on the interviews with Ewan going on about feminism and patriarchy without barely even being asked about such topics. The marketing for the movie screams woke, but you're right, you can't judge it until you see it. I for one, don't care about that, I'm more so irritated that they bastardized one of my favorite characters, Cassandra Caine, just probably so Harley could seem more interesting in comparison.", "cid": "UgzOaMADkGN9w5mVVG94AaABAg.94iofinLqP_94ixKRR6Gac", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

We get movies and tv shows all the time with that; house of cards, American psycho, etc. that's nothing new. The problem they had was means in which the film tried to make the joker a sympathetic character by having him be a social outcast with mental health problems. And prior to seeing this film, from the trailers, you could guess that the film would use these traits to make the joker sympathetic. And then you watch the film its not only that but in the film he gains the support in the general population he never had by doing horrific things. \n\nHaven't seen birds of prey, but I doubt that's what happens in this movie.", "cid": "Ugysue0FzA0KLA7xrSh4AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}

But with DC, the only bad guy that actually worked for me was Zod in Man Of Steel. Shazam and Aquaman's villains had potential but didn't really go anywhere, and Justice League's Steppenwolf was a joke. McGregor looks like he's doing a fantastic job here, but the character seems incredibly thin. The movie's pretty short.

Just because Margot might play role of Harley well doesnt mean yet anything to me if the other characters are not that interesting nor the story.\n\nBut the good thing is that DC/Warner were somehow able to pick up the pieces and move on to movies that are completely independent from one another instead of building this cinematic universe anymore.

They reason Arthur went off the deep end in the first place is because he did not receive the proper care he needed.

The movie is not only for addressing mental health, it is also addressing and criticizing big money in healthcare and the influence billionaire fatcats have on policy. You know that word? \"Policy\"? You know where it came from? That's right, from the word \"Political\".\nOh, you're not a trumptard, you just don't recognize the politics in the things you like because you inherently see politics as something that's bad, despite most media having them. You have always been a part of the spectacle, and you will always be part of the spectacle.

You're ignoring the politics of the movies you like, while acting like they ruin movies you don't like. I've seen this tons, with people swearing up and down, for example that Terminator's never been feminist, or that anime's apolitical, despite both those movies and that medium being way more heavy-handed than Birds of Prey is. This isn't an assumption I made, this is an observation based on what you said, and it falls in line with my experience of pretty much everyone else who complains about leftist politics in movies.\nUh... yes, that is literally what happened in that scene lol. We exclusively see minorities troughout Joker stuck in shitty apartments in low-wage jobs, we exclusively see only white rich people blind to the suffering of those poor people while directly causing it in the case of Arthur and everyone affected by the garbage, and the only bad poor people are white people.\nIn a sharp contrast, Bird of Prey never say all men are bad. The only male in the movie that is a bad person because they're a male is the main villain, the rest are all completely understandable. Furthermore, the movie realizes that Harley's a bad person, and half the point of the movie's her also realizing she's a bad person and working to fix it. There's a reason why only Sionis wants to murder her for completely arbitrary reasons, while every other person that goes after her was ACTUALLY wronged by her. The misogynist is the exception, not the rule. Also, women wanna kill her too.\nI'm specifically bringing BOP up because your comment said that Margot's haunted by \"political bullshit\" because media wants to force politics into everything. The politics of Joker are way more forced than the politics of BOP, and that does not make either movie bad.", "cid": "UgwbAKaBhclg4YJNrlV4AaABAg.94ilFqp7Ecp94me1hGNKex", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

This movie is about Harley, not the group. It‚Äôs a little disappointing but expected because Harley/Margot brings in the most money. Just a safe business move that will work out, but a little bit of a bother since the movie shouldn‚Äôt have been focused primarily about her but the rest of the cast. Nonetheless I did really have fun watching it, but it was a very simple character showing so I wasn‚Äôt fully invested with any of the characters. Love you Chris. Thanks again for another great review", "cid": "UgxkFkH6ZABipMCKDP14AaABAg", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

My mom had to have C-sections for both my older half-sister, and for me. My mom was about 28 when she had my sister, and other than the C-section, no big problems. My mom had at least one miscarriage before me (for some reason fertility issues tend to show up on both sides of my family), and she was getting old, being 40 when she had me and I think it caused issues. I, on the other hand, gave my mom diabetes while she was pregnant, and it went away after I was born. They actually had to call my mom‚Äôs doctor she had seen throughout her pregnancy, and the hospital was so full people were having kids in closets if they were big enough. But they found out the umbilical cord was wrapped around my whole body, especially around my neck, so I was actually turning blue because I was basically getting strangled. And for some reason I apparently had a bowel movement because I was covered in my own waste as well when they pulled me out.\n\nFortunately they got me out in time, and after getting the cord problem situated, I was good. I always wanted another sibling though because my sister was so much older, and she began to be emotionally and mentally abusive when I was as young as 3 years old (it got a lot worse when I was older) - like taking my baby blanket, throwing it on the ceiling fan and threatening to start the fan to shred the blanket. Fortunately she had a tall friend over who grabbed it, and gave it back to me - but she did all that just because I had to walk by the living room to get to the kitchen where I was going to get a snack or something. I didn‚Äôt even go into the living room, and if I remember and I did, it would have been to grab a toy or something and I wasn‚Äôt going to stay in there since she had a friend over (but had to watch me as mom and dad were working). But my mom and dad told me they really did consider having another kid (though our house would have been too small really), but they looked at all the issues like my mom‚Äôs miscarriages and then all the issues popping up when mom was pregnant with me, and she would getting closer to being 42 or 43 years old if she did get pregnant...They decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the risks, or the money trying to care for 3 kids at that time. I was hoping to have kids, but here I am at 30, never having been on a date (though had a one night stand at a party but insisting on a condom), and living with my parents because of mental health and other issues (like doctors basically writing me off as dead when I had liver and respiratory failure in May 2018 because of PTSD and losing 160 lbs in 10 months because I slowly lost the ability to eat), and I have PCOS. I could try for a kid if I wanted, but my parents support me fully financially, and they‚Äôre in their 70s now, and I feel it isn‚Äôt fair to them to have to care and support ANOTHER person. And if for some reason neither of them make it to 80 (since dad is going to be 73 this year and mom 71), I have no idea where I‚Äôll be financially or anything. So I feel it isn‚Äôt fair to bring a kid into the world no matter how much I want one, and I‚Äôm kind of sad I may never have a kid...\n\nBut I hope your delivery goes well! And congrats ü•≥ !

I was in hospital for 7 weeks, and had a 40% chance of survival when my liver was failing - then I went into respiratory failure for over a week, so I‚Äôm sure that 40% went lower. My parents said they were basically told that it might be a good idea to look into funeral arrangements, and for 2.5 weeks the doctors didn‚Äôt know if I was going to pull through - my mom said she was terrified any time the phone rang because she was scared it would be the hospital saying I died. And I was hallucinating as well - I unfortunately was also conscious the whole time my lungs were failing (I was at 82% saturation oxygen level in 2 seconds without oxygen, and critical levels are 88/89%, which shows how sick I was), and my parents came to visit but I couldn‚Äôt talk because I had a full face oxygen mask, and my body had eaten most of my muscles, so I lost the ability to write. So I couldn‚Äôt communicate. But they came anyway, saying sometimes I was aware, and sometimes I was asleep or hallucinating so I had no idea they were there. But I permanently damaged my liver to the degree that I can never drink alcohol again, and I damaged my thyroid to a degree that I have to take medicine in the morning before I eat (whereas I never had thyroid issues before). And I developed neuropathy in my right foot - basically your nerves are firing off 24/7, it basically makes your almost completely numb, and you can‚Äôt run because you can‚Äôt fully control your foot. But when you initially develop it, it‚Äôs insanely painful - like even air hitting would trigger pain that made me scream. But now I limp but at least the pain is gone. And I have a severe back injury that I caused in 2015 that doctors haven‚Äôt really taken care of, but about 6 vertebrae all the way down to my tailbone are shot, and I think the injury might have done something to my nervous system as I‚Äôve developed Tourettes like episodes after the injury, which also causes pain that requires me to be on opioids.\n\nBut I have no idea what kind of jobs you can do from home. Like, I do art - my profile pic is an old doodle from about 6 years ago that I did in 10 minutes or so (not counting the coloring) - but I don‚Äôt know what else you can do.", "cid": "Ugwot176eO6CqGChgm14AaABAg.94ijcYgtt1L94j1azGX5es", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

But also to discuss mental health. For YEARS I was trying to find a diagnosis for what I had, and it was when I was no longer dying and put back in a normal room and not ICU, they had a psychiatrist come talk to me. I told him how I ended a toxic friendship, and she decided to go on Facebook and claim I verbally and physically abused her when my parents and I took her to Disneyland. Idiot didn‚Äôt block me (I had the brains to unfriend AND block her), so I left my side of the story and that those who believed her could talk to her dad and a friend she called who cussed us out on the trip (which was in October 2017) until she actually listened to our side of the story and no longer believed my ex-friend. But she caused me so much stress I had about 3 psychotic breaks in a week, I actually lost ALL emotions for 2 weeks in February 2018, and I was hallucinating off and on for months. And he easily diagnosed me (which peeved me because how could I have seen 3 or 4+ psychiatrists and they not diagnose me) with Borderline Personality Disorder. And I also have a majority of psychopathic traits - like I can easily detach emotionally. The issue is that if I DO connect emotionally, and something goes wrong with that relationship, it affects severely. My reaction would be considered as over-dramatic, so I get severely judged, but that‚Äôs my genuine reaction - because my BPD means my emotions are VASTLY different (I would suggest Google to find out more because otherwise this would be a VERY long reply) from the normal person. I don‚Äôt emotionally connect as fast or easily, and when I do and something goes wrong, it mentally and emotionally hits me harder than people who don‚Äôt have BPD.\n\nI also have been put in the psych ward when I was 16, and once or twice in 2018 when I was ill and shouldn‚Äôt have been put in there. And I‚Äôm suicidal pretty much every day - I‚Äôll be fine and then suddenly be hit with the desire to just end it all, and then throw in severe PTSD. And I‚Äôm atheist, so I fell back on myself rather than some God to get better, home in 7 weeks when originally it was going to possibly be 2 - 3 months (just like I had a feeding tube and they told me I could have it for 2 - 4+ months, and it was gone in just under 2 months and I relearned how to walk unaided in under 2 months when initially I lost the ability to walk because I lost all muscles in my legs and couldn‚Äôt even stand). So my therapist said clearly there‚Äôs a strength in me if I pulled through when the liver doctor wrote me off as dead because of my numbers, and that I didn‚Äôt have a religion I fell back on. But I feel like no one would read a blog, or watch my videos, talking about how to get through each day, or occasionally doing art. I feel people would find it too depressing even when I would have positive writings/videos. And I have no idea how to promote it so people could find it if they were interested. But perhaps I could look into your other suggestions as a way to make some money.", "cid": "Ugwot176eO6CqGChgm14AaABAg.94ijcYgtt1L94jBPltejWj", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ"}

Maybe help others with my words, but maybe also use it as a form of therapy for me. Especially as all my psych specialists say I shouldn‚Äôt physically confront my ex-friend, who ALL my doctors (that‚Äôs including my gastroenterologist who saved my life and other doctors, and about 5 psych specialists) say I could say is solely what nearly caused my death - as with my BPD, and her psychopathic and narcissistic actions (which a mutual friend of ours says she‚Äôs always had - like her mother died of cancer and at the funeral she was crying, but once she was in a more private setting like at home, and with only a couple of people or so she trusted, she actually was vile in the way she talked about her DEAD mother - she even did it with MY mom when we were over one time and my mom couldn‚Äôt believe how she was subtly insulting her mother) something bad was bound to happen. And it doesn‚Äôt help she lives about a half mile to a mile away from me.

Perhaps one of my subjects I could cover are warning signs of a toxic friendship, and how/when to end, and how to prepare for possible fallout depending on the other person‚Äôs personality or other ‚Äúissues‚Äù.

I know exactly how I feel about a movie (if it's one that I really wanted to see).  I will down vote the video if I think the critic missed the point of the movie and consequently is misleading all of his audience into not seeing it (when it's actually quite good).  Down votes are a meaningful way to give feedback and tell other viewers, \"Hey, this critic might not be right about this.  Check it out for yourself.\"  I guess I have a totally different opinion because I think down votes are more helpful than up votes (especially if one knows, or strongly feels, the critic missed something important in the review).  Up voting every single review just seems silly and pointless to me, but I do give my share of up votes.  The best comments under any review video are always the ones that counter what the critic had to say and make people think about the movie in a different light.  These comments probably help the channel's algorithm more than anything else because people want to be stimulated by different views and ideas.  The 1.2K down votes here are trying to tell people something (mainly- \"Judge it for yourself\").  Chris is the only reviewer (I know of) who gave a negative assessment of Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance; there are quite a few other critics who actually singled her out for how good she is in the movie.

The movie's plot and characters were incredibly mismatched and all over the fucking place, it was like listening to someone who doesnt talk to people tell about their day. It was unreal to me that it was made and directed the way it was.\n2. It's only fun in so much as you don't really care about any of these people, they were one dimensional, boring, and it made me realize how deadshot was the only competent one in suicide squad. Maybe it was the story or maybe her acting, but this movie was un-intentionally laughable in the ways that it wasn't meant to be.\n3. Swear to god, the dialogue was written by a 12 year old boy \n4. The way all the characters un-intentionally connected to each other was so fucking loose and lackluster, and the cops motivation made no sense, the cops relationships made no sense and no animosity was shown with the people they were supposed to. Total waste of a big name actor.\n5. Ewan mcgregor's worst role i've ever seen him in.\n6. Nothing made sense, none of the humor landed the way it was supposed to. \n7. No one went to see it opening night (just got back from premier and me and my girlfriends were the only ones)\n8. Some of the shots were like I was watching a hardees commercial.\n9. Action was okay, the events that lead to the action didn't make sense.\n10. Motivations? The only one with a real motivation was Harley, and she was just being aimless. Huntress was played for laughs, but it was so badly timed and so badly executed that it was hard NOT to audibly sigh.\n11. The hyena got blown up. I thought when harley was looking for it saying he \"ran away\" that she didnt want to cope, but at the end of the fucking movie it actually was alive? We saw it get BLOWN UP.\n12. This was the worst movie i've seen in a long LONG time. Suicide Squad was loads better.\n13. The animation at the beginning was a great touch, the ferris bueller voice over was hard to take. This movie even copied some action scenes from wonder woman, and genre wise it couldnt keep up with itself. It was genre defying, it was insane, and not in a good way.  The woman who wrote it NEEDED someone to look over it again and point out the flaws of it, there are so much. Just way too fucking many for a movie with a budget this size, but what do you expect?\n14. The costumes for birds of prey at the very end were laughably horrendous- it was like from a low budget TV show im the 90s.\n\nI guess i just want this movie to fail?", "cid": "UgwJQL0b6hBWt9jp3N94AaABAg.94ijTJ24QXy94il3ANtl3z", "time": "4Í∞úÏõî Ï†Ñ(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)"}
